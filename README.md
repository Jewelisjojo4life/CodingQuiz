# CodingQuiz
This weekly challenge is a quiz that i wasnt able to fully complete. While the time works it doesnt stop when the quiz is finished and runs until it completly runs out of time. The score shows up but will not go away unless page is refreshed or time completly runs out. Was unable to increment the -10 feature when wrong answer was clicked
